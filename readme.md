# SVHN - MNIST (Bias Detection and Performance Comparision on different Models)
Train a three layer dense neural network on the pre-defined training set of the SVHN
dataset for 10-class classification. With the trained model:
(a) Report the classification performance obtained on the training and testing set of the
SVHN dataset.
(b) Report the classification performance obtained on the test set of the MNIST dataset. Is
there a substantial difference between the performance on the MNIST and the SVHN
datasets? If yes, what type of bias can this be attributed to?
(c) Repeat (a-b) with any two other classifiers of your choice (SVM, RDF, K-NN etc.).
Comment upon the robustness of the chosen classifiers for the problem identified in (b).
